Salon Booking enables the reservation to one-on-one business between a client and a staff member.

== Description ==

Salon Booking enables the reservation to one-on-one business between a client and a staff member, 
namely those businesses like hair salon, hospital, dental clinic and so on..

Salon Booking requires neither member registration to make reservations from on the Web sites, 
nor loses prospective clients who hesitate to register personal information. 
To prevent the wrongful registration and reservation, 
the reservation procedure is devised for the clients with no registration at all 
as follows; "tentative reservation", "response to the e-mail address who tentatively reserved", 
and "confirmation by the client on the confirmation screen on the Web sites".
And if a client agrees to register, the reservation is done at once and 
the change of the reservation is also becoming easier, 
which might be an additional incentive for the clients to register.

The interface for the reservation is easy and like that of Google Calendar.
The change of the reservation is possible by means of drag and drop, 
which enables also the staff member phoned by a client for the change 
of the request can easily change the schedule accordingly.

Salon Booking is also capable of the personnel management of the staff member
on the shift control and time recording. 
Of course the possible time ranges of reservation 
and the attendance of the staff member co-relates automatically. 

Salon Booking can also record the actual performance against the reservation 
and capable of compiling the information on the demands from the clients 
and working results. 
So, it is very useful in improving the service quality and the operation management of staff.

As for the security, all the measures are included in this system, 
namely against identity frauds, malicious requests to reserve, SQL injection attacks and so.
